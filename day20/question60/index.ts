/* Question : 60
        Self-Running User Profile: Create a quick, self-setup profile for a user that can tell you the user's name and age.

        Explain & TIP : This is like a self-building lego set. Once you start it, it builds a user profile by itself and can tell you about the user.
*/

// This profile sets itself up and can share info about the user
let userProfile = (function(){
// The user's details are kept inside
let name= "John";
let age= 30;

//This part shares the user's details
return { displayInfo : function(){
    console.log(`Name: ${name}, Age: ${age}`);
}}
})();
//Asking he profile to tell us about the user
userProfile.displayInfo(); // It says the user's name and age
// We made a self-setup profile that can talk about the user.
