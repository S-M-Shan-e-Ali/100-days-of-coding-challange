/* Question : 118
        Write a loop that logs numbers from 1 to 10 to the console.

        Explain & TIP : A for loop is a concise way to run a block of code a specific number of times. It's perfect for when you know exactly how many iterations you need.
*/

// This loop logs numbers from 1 to 10
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    console.log(i); // Logs the current value of i
  }
  // Each iteration increases the value of i by 1, logging it until it reaches 10.
